# VirtualMemorySimulator
Project for COMP3500 (Intro to Operating Systems). Project aims to simulate virtual memory. Included are representations of a page table, TLB, and main memory. Logical addresses are read in from a text file and translated to physical addresses which index main memory. Project can be ran from the terminal by cloning, navigating to the project directory, and typing "make". This creates the executable "virtual memory".
